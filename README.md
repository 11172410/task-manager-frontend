# DTS Developer Challenge - Task Manager Front End

This is the front-end for the task manager app as part of the coding challenge for the MOJ Junior Software Developer role. The front-end is written in JavaScript, using the React framework.

To view the task manager app, please type the command `npm run dev`. To ensure all API calls can be correctly made, the backend server must **also** be open. Please see the respective README for instructions on how to run the server.
